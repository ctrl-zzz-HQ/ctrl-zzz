1. Start with PNG sequence (500x500)
2. Using After Effects + Media Encoder, convert PNG sequence to H.264 MP4. This does not have transparency so will have a black background.
3. Generate WEBM (with transparency): ffmpeg -framerate 30 -i <PNG sequence prefix>%2d.png -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p "Logo 500x500.webm"
4. Generate ProRes4444: ffmpeg -framerate 30 -i <PNG sequence prefix>%2d.png -c:v prores_ks -pix_fmt yuva444p10le -alpha_bits 16 -profile:v 4444 -f mov -vframes 150 "Logo 500x500.mov"
5. Generate HEVC (with transparency):
  1. Right click MOV file
  2. "Encode Selected Video Files"
  3. Select an HEVC setting from dropdown
  4. Check "Preserve Transparency"
  5. Continue
6. Use the MOV file generated by step 5, NOT the one generated by step 4.
