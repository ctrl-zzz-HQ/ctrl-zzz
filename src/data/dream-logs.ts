The alarm clock sounds, cutting the image short.

"Just what was that dream...?" Lyn mutters under her breath. She pauses dazed for a moment before pushing the sheets aside and stepping out of bed.

Fragments of what transpired flicker through her mind like anxious flames.

It starts with feeling lost in a crowd of people, on an unfamiliar street. Everything is blurring with movement around her, except for a shadow in the distance. The shadow lingers, looking around nervously. When it notices her glance, it taps its watch in a cruel taunt and begins to flee.

Without understanding why, she is compelled to chase. The moment she leaves her starting post, the edges of the world begin to close in rapidly. The ground trembles and... glitches? No matter how hard she tries to catch up, the distance between them remains painfully the same. In an instant, she loses sight of the shadow and slows to a stop, trying to catch her breath. Where did it go?

As each image flows into the next, the details shift and blur. Before she can finish replaying the events, the memories begin falling off and everything fades to black.

She doesn’t know what it is but something feels off.

And this isn’t the first time she’s felt this way.

A row of intelligence engineers are typing furiously in their terminals.

"Last night’s trial was rough. How did everyone else’s sims go?"
"Prospective 2 seemed receptive enough but the portal took the shape of a manhole! I was so mad when I realized, like what are the chances... It wasn’t even open!"
"How the hell was she even going to pry that open?"
"I don’t think they know what to do with the portal."
"Three repeated days in reality, you would think they would start to harbor some suspicion about their dreams being the only thing to set each day apart..."
"I don’t know... Maybe some of them live very mundane lives."
"Maybe they aren’t the right ones?"
"No! I triple-checked. We got the right cohort."
"Guys, it’s just gonna need some more finessing in the simulation."
"We don’t have much time left though... The threads are breaking apart."

One of them stands up from their station.

"Wrap up your sims everyone. We have to leave in five minutes."

The clicking and tapping of keys speeds up and the room falls into quiet concentration.`,
