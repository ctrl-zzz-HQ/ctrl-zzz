The alarm clock sounds, cutting the image short.

"Just what was that dream...?" Lyn mutters under her breath. She pauses dazed for a moment before pushing the sheets aside and stepping out of bed.

Fragments of what transpired flicker through her mind like anxious flames.

It starts with feeling lost in a crowd of people, on an unfamiliar street. Everything is blurring with movement around her, except for a shadow in the distance. The shadow lingers, looking around nervously. When it notices her glance, it taps its watch in a cruel taunt and begins to flee.

Without understanding why, she is compelled to chase. The moment she leaves her starting post, the edges of the world begin to close in rapidly. The ground trembles and... glitches? No matter how hard she tries to catch up, the distance between them remains painfully the same. In an instant, she loses sight of the shadow and slows to a stop, trying to catch her breath. Where did it go?

As each image flows into the next, the details shift and blur. Before she can finish replaying the events, the memories begin falling off and everything fades to black.

She doesn’t know what it is but something feels off.

And this isn’t the first time she’s felt this way.

A row of intelligence engineers are typing furiously in their terminals.

"Last night’s trial was rough. How did everyone else’s sims go?"
"Prospective 2 seemed receptive enough but the portal took the shape of a manhole! I was so mad when I realized, like what are the chances... It wasn’t even open!"
"How the hell was she even going to pry that open?"
"I don’t think they know what to do with the portal."
"Three repeated days in reality, you would think they would start to harbor some suspicion about their dreams being the only thing to set each day apart..."
"I don’t know... Maybe some of them live very mundane lives."
"Maybe they aren’t the right ones?"
"No! I triple-checked. We got the right cohort."
"Guys, it’s just gonna need some more finessing in the simulation."
"We don’t have much time left though... The threads are breaking apart."

One of them stands up from their station.

"Wrap up your sims everyone. We have to leave in five minutes."

The clicking and tapping of keys speeds up and the room falls into quiet concentration.`

A golden pocket watch cheekily slips out of Joy’s pocket and falls onto the disco floor with a light clink. The item, with its barely noticeable weight missing, succeeds in catching the attention of its dizzy owner who instinctively stumbles forward to reach for it.

As her hand meets the cold metal, reality trickles into her mind.

"Time... What time is it...?"

She closes her eyes to steady herself. A dull ache pulses from the back of her head.

"Yes, right. Time! Time was running out..."

And suddenly, eyes wide, she exclaims, "Time is running out!"

~

"We haven’t heard back from Kiyoo and Yobu on the Supernova case since yesterday."

Lyn spoke cautiously. It was her third day after joining the ctrl*zzz team. She had been tasked with checking updates on open cases and she wasn’t quite sure whether this issue she was flagging would be helpful or obvious.

"Haven’t heard back?" Aida cocked her head in confusion.

"Yes so... the message last received in the terminal was from three days ago when they had just arrived at Nova Bar. As for whether they successfully made it to their posts or what the situation looks like inside... Nothing."

"What the hell..." Naya muttered under her breath from the station to the right. She was monitoring the intelligence dashboard with a cup of herbal tea in one hand and a hot compress in the other <i>(the poor recruit had gotten sick just after orientation)</i>.

"Nova Bar is notorious for its addictive music and drinks and attracts all sorts of people. It’s been rumored that the bar operates in a different dimension and multiple realities twist inside of it, whatever that means. According to this report, those two originally went there to figure out why people have been mysteriously disappearing from there..." Her voice trailed off as her eyes met Aida’s and Lyn’s. The three went silent with worry.


"Well we can’t just stand here and watch, can we?" Lyn timidly starts. She pushes up her glasses and smiles reassuringly. "We’re a team now, right?"

Aida grins and turns to Naya.

"Call the rest of the team and start the transporters. We’re heading out at twelve o’clock sharp."

~

The lights in the bar are dim and the air is thick with vibrations of bass-boosted music and raucous laughter. Incomprehensible chatter followed by the clatter of glass on glass – a number of sounds blend together in a cacophonous symphony.

Kiyoo tugs at his tie, hoping to loosen it a bit for the stifling environment to come. Yobu takes a deep breath and gulps down his nerves.

The duo treads carefully into the establishment, making their way with haste to the bar.

"Yobu, take a spot closer to the crowd and observe for a bit. Try not to get too close."

"You got it boss."

The young apprentice gets to preparing a tray of drinks and glasses of water to bring with him on his assignment.

"Report back here as soon as possible."


Yobu makes his way closer to the dance floor in the center of the room and floats around the edge of the dense crowd. He watches as party-goers pull party-goers in and out of the crowd in a rhythmic cycle, as they groove and jive to the contagious beat.

Two party-goers, drunken and dazed, slink over to Yobu, slithering their arms around his shoulders. His body turns to ice, as panic shakes the tray of drinks in his arms. One of them tugs at his sleeve to grab a drink from the tray while the other whispers in his ear.

"You lost waiter boy?"

"N-No, I’m-!"


A muffled scream rings in Kiyoo’s ears. Instinctively, he scans the room for his apprentice, but Yobu is nowhere to be seen. Only a sea of smiling faces and glassy eyes lies before him on the dance floor.

And that’s when it strikes him.

<i>Dance fever? But that’s an old child’s tale. How could it possibly-</i>

Kiyoo pauses and sets his incredulity aside, re-assessing the gravity of the situation. If he too were to fall victim to this contagious disaster, they would both be in serious trouble. He closes his eyes and focuses his mind in an attempt to drown out the music.

~

<i>"Well, we’re here guys." Aida looks up at the sign hanging above the entrance.</i>

<i>"Remember, stick together, if you get lost, you can send an alert through your wristbands to the others back at the base. Joy, Nezu, Yenii–you have the failsafes if we need them."</i>


Joy drifts through the room, repeating those instructions in her head as she searches for any signs of abnormality. Suddenly, she catches the gaze of a silver-haired bartender a couple paces away. She doesn’t recognize him but he scrutinizes her, almost as if he is testing her.

Before she can react, he begins to walk in her direction. Unsure of whether or not to make a run for it, he closes in on her and her hand is surprisingly met with a small slip of paper. The bartender promptly slides past her and disappears into the darkness.

She grasps the note firmly and slips away to the nearest corner to read its contents.

~

A throng of party-goers condense in the center of the room, their bodies twisting and turning into each other on the dance floor.

Atel searches through the crowd, the drink in her hand half-empty and chaotically swirling around. Her face reads desperation and regret, with a twinge of shame. Her mind is racing with all the possible dooms that might have befallen her teammate by now. If only she had chased after him from the start!

After pushing past two dancers, she catches sight of the face she’s been looking for.

"Nezu!"

The tall figure turns to look at her, smiling and out of breath. His glossed-over eyes and disheveled appearance send a shiver down her spine.

Feverish and frenzied, Nezu extends his hand to Atel.

"Dance with me, won’t you?"

And in that instant, he grabs her by the wrist and pulls her in.

<i>Aw shit.</i>

~

Joy tightens her grip on the pocket watch and steadies her mind.

3, 2, 1... Click.

"Incoming."

With a loud buzz and spark, a portal flickers open in the center of the room. All the agents tumble out, thudding onto the floor in a dogpile as gravity pulls them flat on their faces onto the marble surface. They’re dressed to the nines and visibly exhausted.

"Welcome back guys. That was a close call, you were just about out of time."


Relieved to be back, the agents picked themselves off the cold ground one by one, some embarrassed and chuckling, others tremendously spent, with everyone in the room glad to have each other.

ACT 2 EPILOGUE

<i>[The agents have just catastrophically landed back at headquarters in a pile.]</i>

"Man... I told you that because of Newton’s Third Law, equal forces must have equal reactions, but you said that because time and space run differently in the Supernova, you just <i>had</i> to swap the reactor with the force gauge! And now, I’ll never be able to get that secret mocktail at Nova that Kiyoo was boasting about!"

"Woof!" Lilp barks with glee, and proceeds to call the marionette’s attention to the sore pile of humans on her left.

"Oh. What a dramatic entrance."

"You think..?" Aida grumbles in response from the bottom.

"Wait, someone forgot a shoe back there."

With the swish of her hand, Naya signals for the portal to be opened again, and it does, appearing briefly to chuck the remaining lost heel back.

Aida lets out a yelp of dismay as she is hit in the head.

"Well, that was <i>something</i> alright." Joy sighs out of exhaustion.

"You can say that again," Peach yawns. "I don’t think I’ve ever felt this tired in my life, serving drinks and dancing..." She sinks deeper into the slouch she was already in, her spine curving like a shrimp.

"Same here," Lyn notes.

"Same for me," Yobu groggily chimes in.

Kiyoo nods his head in agreement.

"At least everyone had a great time, right?" Atel looks around and laughs, trying to look on the bright side of things.
"I know I did, although things got a bit chaotic at the end..." Nezu chuckles sheepishly. "Sorry about all that Atel. Being possessed... is definitely a new experience for me." Everyone nods in agreement with his remark, taking a moment to appreciate that they made it out safely and were all back to normal.
"Okay but honestly, that was one of the best parties I’ve ever been to in my life," Joy smiles. "This will be in my memories forever."
"Wanna take a group photo to commemorate?" Yenii chimes in, holding a camera in hand.

"Yeah!"

"Gather ‘round everyone!" Aida calls out.

With that, everyone pushes into the center of the headquarters and readies themselves for the shot. The flash of Yenii’s camera illuminates the room, capturing the memory of their first mission together.

As the others proceed to rest up after the long mission, Nat picks up the camera and examines the polaroid, smiling at the image. Aida notices her and pats her on the shoulder.

"We did a good job didn’t we?"

"Yep. We did."

Nat smiles as she places the photo onto the table beside her. The two look towards the other members bustling about headquarters and happily chatting amongst one another, as the clock turns from night to morning.`,

    text: `It has been a couple months since the dance fever fiasco. The new ctrl*zzz members have since settled into their regular time-jumping routine and the fledgling team has done an excellent job streamlining its operation into a well-oiled machine.

What they don’t know is that the gears of fate are turning in the wrong way. The meltdown at Nova Bar was just one stray wrinkle in time that had managed to snowball its way to the surface, a mere fraction of the cataclysm that lay in wait.

The threads are fraying at an alarming rate... And members are finding it increasingly hard to return to the central timeline.

Could this be the end?

~

<i>In 1850s England, Nat and Lyn sit for morning tea. They have been undercover at the Williams estate for a fortnight, searching for a hidden space-time rift.</i>

"What say you that we stay a little longer?" Nat says while reaching for a crumpet. "The morning spreads are delightful here and the Williams have been more than good to us."

Lyn sips her tea, held in a Foley cup adorned with forget-me-nots.

"It has been rather delightful, hasn’t it... Like a dream within a dream."

"This latest mission has been a real doozy in that—"

"Nathania... Language..." Lyn chides her and looks around for any eavesdroppers.

"Oh come on Lynette, you are such a worrywort! No one suspects a thing."

In the two weeks that the both of them have been in this timeline, they haven’t found a single clue as to where the rift might be.

"As I was saying, the last lead I had was from Elijah, Master Henry’s butler, who said that he was feeling under the weather. But I think, a head cold in spring doesn’t seem too out of the ordinary, does it?"

"No, I suppose not..."

Lyn leans in to whisper, "Nat... You don’t suppose the threads here have already broken? Naya mentioned that a rift will actually close and surge to a new line if the threads have been broken."

"Mm... It can’t be that bad right? I think it’s just well-hidden, because by gosh, this manor is huge. And I saw some storm clouds the other day which can’t be a good sign."

"Alright, let’s give it a couple more days."

~

Back at headquarters, the room is rather lonely and cold. Lilp and Yan have unknowingly fallen into a deep slumber, sharing the couch in the lounge area.

All the other members are out on missions. Nat and Lyn in 1850s England. Peach and Yenii in the roaring 20s. Everyone else on reconnaissance in various locations in the local timeline. But they sure are taking longer than expected...

Suddenly, the radio flicks on with nothing but static coming through the speakers.

A voice breaks through the noise, choppy and urgent.

"ZZZZKiyooZZ, can youZZZZ me?ZZZZZ"
"I’m currentlyZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. For some reason, Peach and Yenii areZZZZZZbutZZZZ"
"Hold on I thinkZZZZZZZ"
"ZZZZAhhZZZZwhat theZZZZZ"

The transmission ends.

~

The morning light seeps through the curtains in Joy’s room as she lay asleep under her blankets. Her brows are tense and knitted in the moments leading up to her rousing. They soften a bit as she opens her eyes into a tired squint.

"What a dream..." She sighs.

Still laying there, she lets the details linger on for a moment before reaching for her phone on her bedside table. Something about a mission. Urgency. Needing to tell... someone? Something? She taps her phone twice to check the time... It’s 6:48am.

What was she thinking about just now?

Ah yes... Her dream.

Just what happened in her dream?

It was always like this.

Because of this, Joy had started logging her dreams in a journal. Most days, if she doesn’t write the moment she comes to, the details are instantly lost and she can only manage to jot down the emotions she is left with.

She reaches for her journal and writes the following.

Searching. Nervous. Scared to be alone.

~

Standing at shore, Aida watches the tide come and go, erasing all kinds of little scratches in the wet sand.

She hasn’t felt right for a couple of days. It’s as if there is something missing or that she has forgotten something important. And she cannot, for the life of her, figure out what it is.

Bending over, she scoops up some sand with her hands.

The day before yesterday, she had woken up with a fever from a delirious dream. The only details she could remember from the dream were a clock spinning backwards and the name Nezu. The rest had slipped away, just like how the sand was currently sifting through her fingers and into the sea.

On her way home, Aida sees a white-haired youth walking in the opposing direction. They pass each other briefly. All the while, Aida’s mind is racing. This person seems oddly familiar, who are they?

Mustering up her courage, she swings around and hurries to catch up to the boy.

"Hey!" She exclaims. "I really don’t mean this in a weird way but... Have we met before? I feel like I know you even though... Even though I don’t know your name."

"Oh uh... Hi."

"Sorry this must be really weird."

"Actually, I’m a bit taken aback... When you passed me, I thought I recognized you from somewhere. What’s your name?"

"Aida. What’s yours?"

"Nezu."

"Nezu..." Aida repeats, in disbelief. "Nice to meet you, Nezu."

"Nice to meet you, Aida."`,
